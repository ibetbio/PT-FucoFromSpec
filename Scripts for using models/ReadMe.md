We provide a python script for using any of the spectroscopy-based machine learning (ML) models present in Tables 3 and 4 (folder ‘Scripts for using models’). The user is required only to open the file ‘test_model.py’ and make sure the data he/she wants to test is inside the directory of the folder.

The files for the models are too heavy for this repository, they are available upon request!
