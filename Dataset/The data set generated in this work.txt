The data set generated in this work is organized into 6 dataframes (.pkl). These include for all observations (i.e., culture samples) fluorescence and absorbance data, standard analytical data, and information data (i.e., date, assay type, etc.).

File	- Description
sampledata.pkl	- Labels for each observation within the data set, associating it with the assay and batch of origin, and the date collected; includes alternative Ids for the assays, for the batches, and date/day collected
monitordata.pkl	- Contains the data measured by standard analytical methods for each observation
fluorodata.pkl	- Contains the data measured by 2D-fluorescence for each observation
absdata.pkl	- Contains the data measured by absorbance spectroscopy for each observation
absextdata.pkl	- Contains the data measured by absorbance spectroscopy of the methanol extract of the samples for each observation
no3po4data.pkl	- Contains NO3 and PO4 measurements obtained from the sample supernatants for each observation
